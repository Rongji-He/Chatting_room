# Chatting_room
 Java Chatting room project using Socket, and multiThread. 
 
 Run Server.java under /src first, then run a few instances of Clinet.java under the same folder as the chatter. 
 
 If you are using Intellij IDEA, make sure you check the "allow run parallel" option in Client's run configurations
